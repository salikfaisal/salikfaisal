# Welcome to my GitHub

I’m Salik, and this space is where I explore ideas that interest me — data, society, cities, politics, sports, and the ways quantitative patterns reveal deeper stories about the world. I enjoy using data not just to model or forecast, but to *tell stories* that make complex systems easier to understand.

My interests aren’t limited to a single domain, and my projects tend to reflect that. Some are focused on political behavior or demographic patterns. Others look at housing, transportation, or sports analytics. I like working on questions that require careful reasoning, clean pipelines, and a mix of analytical and narrative thinking.

## What I’m Interested In

### Data & Analytics
- Statistical modeling  
- Simulation and forecasting  
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Geospatial analysis  
- Exploratory analysis and visualization  
- Data storytelling and communication  

### Topics I Explore
- American politics and voter behavior  
- Urban development, housing, and transportation  
- Demographics and long-term social change  
- Sports analytics  
- Economics, incentives, and systems thinking  

### Tools I Use
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, GeoPandas)  
- **R**  
- **SQL**  
- **GIS tools** (Folium, ArcGIS)  
- **Selenium / BeautifulSoup** for scraping  
- **Matplotlib / seaborn** for visualization

## How I Approach Projects
I gravitate toward projects where the data isn’t perfectly clean, the questions are open-ended, and the answers require thoughtful interpretation. I like to:

- Build analytical pipelines that integrate multiple datasets  
- Create structure from uncertainty or ambiguity  
- Use statistics to understand real-world behavior  
- Pair technical findings with narrative explanations

## What You’ll Find Here
This GitHub contains a mix of exploratory notebooks, modeling experiments, geospatial work, and long-form data investigations. Some projects are polished; others are ongoing. All reflect areas I’m actively learning about and refining.

If anything here sparks an idea or you want to discuss a dataset, method, or topic, feel free to reach out.
